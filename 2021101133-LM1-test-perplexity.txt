then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling Perplexity: 866.2463338916068
valentine hid her head between her hands Perplexity: 49.97266396659996

athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued <unk> to a young béarnais a cadet in his majesty s guards the company of monsieur <unk> but scarcely had he arrived at his friend s and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of <unk> and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several <unk> the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to <unk> we all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our <unk> then said <unk> it was also for your majesty s service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times she would his blood in your majesty s service and is ready to she would it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace bah said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed monsieur de <unk> said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest <unk> i defy your eminence to prove it cried <unk> with his gascon freedom and military frankness for one hour before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel with the duc de la <unk> and the comte de <unk> who happened to be <unk> the king looked at the cardinal Perplexity: 136.32910354064597

yes said he yes that would flatter me very much but i should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction Perplexity: 170.16403731196888
then some words were spoken by the two women Perplexity: 62.74857554595472
he was telling me this morning that tired of letting his property lie <unk> in italy which is a dead nation he wished to find a method either in france or england of <unk> his millions but remember that though i place great confidence in busoni i am not responsible for <unk> never mind accept my thanks for the client you have sent me Perplexity: 317.9071966954648

whilst this terrible scene was passing at lord de winter s athos seated near his window his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand was listening intently to raoul s account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle Perplexity: 75.07802631548331
she wore a blue and <unk> vest with long open sleeves trimmed with silver <unk> and buttons of pearls and a sort of bodice which closing only from the centre to the waist exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps Perplexity: 388.79268245337244
you must be satan cried she Perplexity: 93.89840129609107
it may easily be understood therefore that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his eminence s guardsmen had received Perplexity: 175.1016300602625
swear then said villefort joining the hands of morrel and d <unk> swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my <unk> d <unk> turned round and uttered a very feeble yes but morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and anguish Perplexity: 119.19018680366192
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more Perplexity: 258.032785310734
<unk> has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of m. de monte cristo that you must demand an <unk> albert turned Perplexity: 80.74437516021383
during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france the parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives Perplexity: 454.7365995471689
the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very <unk> this young man must not however fail in his duty said athos Perplexity: 110.62196328871052
in the place of the fowl a dish of <unk> beans made its <unk> enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show themselves Perplexity: 378.57388734611993
morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but monte cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron grasp Perplexity: 252.56442846056873
monsieur you run no risk for as i told you i will stay here so there is no chance of my <unk> you do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatiently Perplexity: 77.15986539056247

it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the events which followed it that madame <unk> heard monte cristo s name announced Perplexity: 119.67414018711544
it appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple thing Perplexity: 58.81770412482344
in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt <unk> s letter Perplexity: 103.13895796627385
there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had great difficulty in <unk> his anger but at a word from <unk> he restrained himself and contented himself with saying you promise <unk> is <unk> i shall find you to-morrow at charenton oh do not be afraid sir replied aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the louvre Perplexity: 126.7637128215036
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister s cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw la <unk> <unk> his <unk> ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the <unk> Perplexity: 174.39320554760903
thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite dark Perplexity: 148.03937435171858
it was about five of the clock Perplexity: 4.725551798397448

monsieur she said <unk> do not understand <unk> and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cushions Perplexity: 155.87692943229845
ah you speak spanish enough i think to fulfill your highness s wishes on this <unk> meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place Perplexity: 138.59367590894075
besides let me own something to you Perplexity: 53.628458189344464
most probably morrel and <unk> returned to their domestic <unk> as they say in the gallery of the chamber in <unk> speeches and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in <unk> pieces but it was not the case with debray Perplexity: 95.87424271339513

how delighted i am to have found you Perplexity: 58.56816490722391
he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as <unk> had done over the <unk> who would have killed him Perplexity: 170.3649237944908

during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges <unk> and <unk> mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man Perplexity: 240.27199083390983
nevertheless aramis was in a good situation and able to defend himself Perplexity: 158.97922730555908
a <unk> placed on the <unk> threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony Perplexity: 207.92816870996134

felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty covered with dust and streaming with perspiration Perplexity: 104.34356405174195

étienne said he see why mademoiselle eugénie has asked me to meet her in the drawing-room and why she makes me wait so long. having given this vent to his <unk> the baron became more calm mademoiselle <unk> had that morning requested an interview with her father and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot Perplexity: 219.1211120592655
d <unk> turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off Perplexity: 207.86845884793115
aramis affected a laugh to divert the attention of certain curious <unk> and perceiving that athos had <unk> himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room Perplexity: 123.15886523678421
what do you say cried d <unk> Perplexity: 11.232001397194466
towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris where indeed he had imagined she still was Perplexity: 142.03724196165257
now gentlemen said d <unk> go up to your room again and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you <unk> the englishmen bowed and went upstairs Perplexity: 74.0816104996592
he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen Perplexity: 269.12910922875506
albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the <unk> always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment Perplexity: 621.0856695087538
i saw the soldier s shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me. well inquired dantès Perplexity: 285.5669673210908

all his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a jug Perplexity: 190.90412875569598
they sent him a magnificent supper and took his million Perplexity: 359.3190292287811
besides i can find my way about the city with my eyes <unk> i wish we were already there said d <unk> and my advice is that we reach london before daybreak even if we kill our <unk> come on then said athos for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to <unk> the friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five of the clock in the morning Perplexity: 122.24692455698543
you are mistaken my lord blood will flow and may that blood fall back on those who because it to flow felton uttered a cry and rushed toward her Perplexity: 442.55548785195754
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared Perplexity: 183.89951279671607
he felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address <unk> an englishman said monte cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which julie looked at him Perplexity: 111.93464899796298

at the top of the stairs upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor was traced in black ink a gigantic number 1. d <unk> knocked and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside he entered the chamber Perplexity: 223.5116586507038

franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted Perplexity: 239.906524247217
from two of the clock till five franz and albert followed in the <unk> exchanging handfuls of <unk> with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight Perplexity: 319.0017493941909

this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for <unk> mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first Perplexity: 147.10514463004026
ten minutes elapsed during which d <unk> made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second Perplexity: 177.1000374031835
